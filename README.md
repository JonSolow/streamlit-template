# streamlit-template

Template Repo for Streamlit Application

This repo can be used as a starting point for developing your Streamlit App.

Here are some of the features of the template:

- VSCode devcontainer.json [TO-DO]
  - docker-compose.yml (specifies how to invoke your local development environment, allowing for local dev features such as multiple containers, port-forwarding, and local file mounting)
  - Dockerfile (specifies how to build your environment, allowing for parity between development environments and production)
- Linting Configuration [TO-DO] (allows for clean code and quicker detection of possible bugs as one of the first steps in Shift-left testing)
  - Black [TO-DO] (code formatting)
  - flake8 [TO-DO] (python PEP standards)
  - mypy [TO-DO] (python code type checking)
- Unit Tests [TO-DO] (create tests of particular units of code to know that your functions will provide the expected behavior or output)
